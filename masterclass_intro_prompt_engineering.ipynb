            "In practice, it means:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Role**  \n",
            "   The LLM acts like a reviewer, grader, or referee. Instead of answering the original task, it is given:\n",
            "   - The task or prompt\n",
            "   - One or more candidate answers (from humans or other models)\n",
            "   - Evaluation criteria (e.g., correctness, coherence, safety, style)\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Typical Uses**\n",
            "   - **Automatic evaluation of model outputs**: scoring answers in benchmarks, competitions, or A/B tests.\n",
            "   - **Preference ranking**: deciding which of two or more responses is better.\n",
            "   - **Feedback generation**: explaining what’s wrong or missing in an answer.\n",
            "   - **Self-improvement loops**: a model generates answers, another (or the same) model judges them, and the feedback is used to refine prompts or training.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **How it’s usually implemented**\n",
            "   - Provide a structured prompt like:\n",
            "     - “Here is the question…”\n",
            "     - “Here are two answers…”\n",
            "     - “Here are the criteria (accuracy, completeness, safety)…”\n",
            "     - “Decide which answer is better and explain briefly.”\n",
            "   - Sometimes the judge is forced to output a strict format (e.g., a numeric score or a label) to make it machine-usable.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Why it’s used**\n",
            "   - Human evaluation is expensive and slow.\n",
            "   - Traditional automatic metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, etc.) are weak for open-ended tasks.\n",
            "   - LLMs can approximate human judgments surprisingly well on many tasks.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Limitations / Risks**\n",
            "   - **Bias and inconsistency**: the judge can favor certain styles or phrasings.\n",
            "   - **Model collusion**: if the same model family is both writer and judge, it may overrate its own style.\n",
            "   - **Vulnerability to prompt attacks**: judged answers can try to “persuade” or jailbreak the judge.\n",
            "   - **Hallucinated confidence**: the judge may sound certain while being wrong.\n",

        "   - Use LLM-as-a-Judge (from Section 2) to evaluate both versions\n",
        "   - Calculate accuracy, relevance, or other metrics\n",
        "   - Document which version performs better\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Iterate if needed**\n",
        "   - If quality is still below 80%, request further improvements\n",
